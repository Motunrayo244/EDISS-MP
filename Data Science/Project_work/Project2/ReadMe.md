# Mini Project II – Students Performance

### Project description
The data was collected from a fully online nine-week-long course on machine learning, hosted on the online learning management system Moodle. The goal of this project is to use two different supervised learning approaches  to predict students’ final grade in an online course.

### Data Description
 The dataset contained anonymized informaon of 107 enrolled students. The data included students’ grades (from 3 mini projects, 3 quizzes and 3 peer reviews and the final overall grade) as well as the course logs. The deadline for the three mini projects fell within weeks 3, 5 and 8 of the course, whereas the deadline for the quizzes fell within weeks 2, 4 and 8.  
 - Status0: relates to course, lectures, contents viewed/ started.
 - Status1: relates to assignment i.e quiz attempted, submitted and/or reviewed,
 - Status2: relates to grade and report viewes (Grade user report viewed, Grade overview report viewed, User graded, Grade deleted, User profile viewed, Recent acvity viewed, User report viewed, Course user report viewed, Outline report viewed)
 - Status3: relates to forum activities(Post updated, Post created,

 Data:
 --  9 grades (Week2_Quiz1, Week3_MP1, ... Week7_MP3) •
 -- 36 logs (Week1_Stat0, Week1_Stat1, Week1_Stat2, Week1_Stat3, ... Week9_Stat0, Week9_Stat1, Week9_Stat2, Week9_Stat3).
