Projects
- Project 1:
	- Project is a webscrapping and explorative data analysis project. It contains the code for scraping flight information from three websites using selenium-sthealth and beautifulsoup.
	- The project was simplified by scrapping flight information for a particular day. 
	- The scrapped data were cleaned and stored in csv files.

 - Project 2
	- 
 - Project 3
   	- This project investigates the interrelationship of various research domains carried out at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
   	- This was conducted via citation analysis of the artifacts published and cited in of those domains.
   	- The goal of this project is to understand which domains have had the high impact on other domains.

Disclaimer
** There is a high possibility that the webscarpping code might break as it largly dependes on the DOM at the time of scrapping.
** Use CSV file in project folder to view and understand the analysis carried out.
