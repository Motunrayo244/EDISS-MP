This folder contains all submissions for data science projects and lab works.

Projects
- Project 1:
	The project is a webscrapping and explorative data analysis project. It contains the code for scraping flight information from three websites using selenium-stealth and beautiful soup.
	- The project was simplified by scrapping flight information for a particular day. 
	- The scrapped data were cleaned and stored in CSV files.
	- This dataset is then analyzed as a whole. 
	- This project aims to analyze and visualize the flight information scrape.
	-   A simple user interface was designed with ipywidgets to enable filtering and show results.
   	Disclaimer
	** There is a high possibility that the web scrapping code might break as it largely depends on the DOM at the time of scrapping.
	** Use the CSV file in the project folder to view and understand the analysis carried out.

 - Project 3
   	- This project investigates the interrelationship of various research domains carried out at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
   	- This was conducted via citation analysis of the artifacts published and cited in those domains.
   	- The goal of this project is to understand which domains have had the highest impact on other domains.
